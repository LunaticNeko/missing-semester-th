Website for the [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) class!

Contributions are most welcome! If you have edits or new content to add, please
open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Development

To build and view the site locally, run:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve -w
```

If you'd prefer to develop the site in a Docker container (e.g., to avoid
having to install Ruby and dependencies on your host machine), run:


```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Then, navigate to <http://localhost:4000> on your host machine to view the
website. Jekyll will re-build the website as you make changes to files.
